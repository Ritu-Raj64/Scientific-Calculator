# üßÆ Scientific Calculator in C++

## üìå Overview
This project is a **Scientific Calculator** built using **C++**, which performs both basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations. It runs in the terminal and gives users a clean, menu-based interface to perform calculations easily.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
1. The program starts by displaying a **menu** of 30+ mathematical operations.  
2. The user selects an option by entering its number (1‚Äì30).  
3. The calculator performs the requested operation and displays the result.  
4. You can type `31` to show the menu again or `0` to exit the program.

## üß© Code Highlights
- Uses `<cmath>` for all math functions.  
- Includes a **factorial()** function using loops.  
- Well-structured **switch-case** for each operation.  
- Error handling for invalid operations like division by zero or invalid input.  
- Constants defined for **PI** for accurate trigonometric calculations.

## üöÄ How to Run

### **Using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Turbo C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code):**
```bash
g++ scientific_calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
